### Overview

The workshop is intended for developer to get hands-on experience to deploy and manage the applications running on Openshift.

The following are the features that are covered in this workshop.

* Basis experience to develop Spring Boot services using CodeReady Workspace.

* Deploy applications into openshift using different methods. 

* Basis CI/CD

* RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

* Resource Management to manage the resources (CPU, Memory) per project

### Agenda

* Introduction to workshop (15 mins)
* Hands On Exercise (1.5 hours)
  * Exercise 1: Explore Developer Console
  * Exercise 2: Develop and Deploy Spring Boot Microservices using CodeReady Workspace
  * Exercise 3: Deploy a sample application from a docker image using Openshift Console
  * Exercise 4: Deploy .net core using Openshift CLI (oc) via source code
  * Exercise 5: Application deployment to next environment
  * Exercise 6: Resource Management
  * Exercise 7: Monitoring Logging 
* Break: 15 mins
* Walkthrough with Q&A: 1 hour
  * With some foundation through the hands-on exercises, we will then be doing a walkthrough with the audience on a live application that based on microservice architecture built and deployed on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. The audience will learn how a new feature can be added with minimum impact to users, using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh to manage traffic flows and scaling the workload with Red Hat OpenShift Serverless together with Red Hat AMQ streams for event streaming. We encourage question and answer anytime during this walkthrough to allow the audience to better appreciate the technology.
